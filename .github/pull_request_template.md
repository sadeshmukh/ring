# Channel Checklist
- [ ] I am a channel manager of the Slack personal channel I am adding.
- [ ] I have added the correct `channel_id` and my `user_id` in `channels.yml`.
- [ ] I have added the `slug` I want for my channel in `channels.yml`.
- [ ] I have added valid previous and next redirect URLs in my channel's description (e.g. https://r.sahil.ink/n/slug and https://r.sahil.ink/p/slug - check Slack for other valid options)
